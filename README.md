# GitHound

![](./images/github_bloodhound.png)

## Overview

**GitHound** is a BloodHound OpenGraph collector for GitHub, designed to map your organization’s structure and permissions into a navigable attack‑path graph. It:

- **Models Key GitHub Entities**  
  - **GHOrganization**: Your GitHub org metadata  
  - **GHUser**: Individual user accounts in the org  
  - **GHTeam**: Teams that group users for shared access  
  - **GHRepository**: Repositories within the org  
  - **GHBranch**: Named branches in each repo  
  - **GHOrgRole**, **GHTeamRole**, **GHRepoRole**: Org‑, team‑, and repo‑level roles/permissions  

- **Visualize & Analyze in BloodHound**  
  - **Access Audits**: See at a glance who has admin/write/read on repos and branches  
  - **Compliance Checks**: Validate least‑privilege across teams and repos  
  - **Incident Response**: Trace privilege escalations and group memberships  

With GitHound, you get a clear, interactive graph of your GitHub permissions landscape—perfect for security reviews, compliance audits, and rapid incident investigations.  

## Collector Setup & Usage

### Creating a Personal Access Token Overview

Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Fine-grained tokens -> Generate new token

* Repository access -> All repositories

* "Administrator" repository permissions (read)
* "Contents" repository permissions (read)
* "Metadata" repository permissions (read)

* "Custom organization roles" organization permissions (read)
* "Custom repository roles" organization permissions (read)
* "Members" organization permissions (read)

### Generate Fine-grained Personal Access Token (Detailed)

This walkthrough is for administrators to create the Fine-grained Personal Access Token that is necessary to collect the data that is necessary for the GitHub based BloodHound Graph. These steps should be followed in the context of an organization administrator in order to ensure the resulting PAT will have full access to Repositories, Users, and Teams in the GitHub Organization.

#### Generate Token

To generate a personal access token browse to your user settings as shown in the image below:

![](./images/1_proile_settings.png)

In the settings menu, scroll to the bottom where you will see the "Developer settings" menu option. Click it.

GitHub offers many options for programmatic access. GitHound, our collector, is built to work with Fine-grained Personal Access Tokens, so click on that menu item.

After reaching the Fine-grained Personal Access Token page, you can click on the "Generate new token" button in the top right corner.

#### Token Settings

Fine-grained Personal Access Tokens offer administrators the ability to specifically control what resources the PAT will have access to.

It is possible to limit the set of repositories that a Fine-grained PAT can interact with. GitHound requires access to all repositories, so we will select the "All repositories" radio button.

Next, we will define the specific repository and organization permissions that GitHound requires. GitHound is a read-only tool, so we will make sure to specify read-only access for each option as shown in the image below:

The following permissions are required:

| Target       | Permission                | Access    |
|--------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Repository   | Administrator             | Read-only |
| Repository   | Contents                  | Read-only |
| Repository   | Metadata                  | Read-only |
| Repository   | Secret scanning alerts    | Read-only |
| Organization | Administrator             | Read-only |
| Organization | Custom organization roles | Read-only |
| Organization | Custom repository roles   | Read-only |
| Organization | Members                   | Read-only |

#### Save Personal Access Token

Once the PAT is created, GitHub will present it to you as shown below. You must save this value (preferably in a password manager) at this point as you will not be able to recover it in the future.

### Running the Collection

1. Open a PowerShell terminal
2. Load `github.ps1` in your current PowerShell session:

 ```powershell
  . ./github.ps1
 ```

3. Create a GitHub Session using your Personal Access Token.

```powershell
$session = New-GitHubSession -OrganizationName <Name of your Organization> -Token (Get-Clipboard)
```

Note: You must specify the name of your GitHub organziation. For example, this repository is part of the `SpecterOps` organization, so I would specify `SpecterOps` as the argument for the OrganizationName parameter. Additionally, you must specify your Personal Access Token. I find that it is easiest to paste it directly from the clipboard as this is where it will be after you create it or if you save it in a password manager.

4.  Run the collection on the specified organization:

```powershell
Invoke-GitHound -Session $session
```

This will output the payload to the current working directory as `githound_<your_org_identifier>.json`.

5. Upload the payload via the Ingest File page in BloodHound or via the API.

### Sample

If you do not have a GitHub Enterprise environment or if you want to test out GitHound before collecting from your own production environment, we've included a sample data set at `./samples/example.json`.

## Usage Examples

### What Repos does a User have Write Access to?

Find the object identifier for your target user:

```cypher
MATCH (n:GHUser)
RETURN n
```

HINT: Select Table Layout

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ddfd075-2a15-4aa9-bad7-74c43e6c82d6

Replace the `<object_id>` value in the subsequent query with the user's object identifier:

```cypher
MATCH p = (:GHUser {objectid:"<object_id>"})-[:GHMemberOf|GHAddMember|GHHasRole|GHHasBaseRole|GHOwns*1..]->(:GHRepoRole)-[:GHWriteRepoContents]->(:GHRepository)
RETURN p
```

### Who has Write Access to a Repo?

Obtain the object identifier for your target repository:

```cypher
MATCH (n:GHRepository)
RETURN n
```

Take the object identifier for your target repository and replace the `<object_id>` value in the subsequent query with it:

```cypher
MATCH p = (:GHUser)-[:GHMemberOf|GHHasRole|GHHasBaseRole|GHOwns|GHAddMember*1..]->(:GHRepoRole)-[:GHWriteRepoContents]->(:GHRepository {objectid:"<object_id>"})
RETURN p
```

### Members of the Organization Admins (Domain Admin equivalent)?

```cypher
MATCH p = (:GHUser)-[:GHHasRole|GHHasBaseRole]->(:GHOrgRole {short_name: "owners"})
RETURN p
```

### Users that are managed via SSO (Entra-only)

```cypher
MATCH p = (:AZUser)-[:SyncedToGHUser]->(:GHUser)
RETURN p
```
